  summary: defers import to when objects are actually used
  description: |
    Often, especially for package modules, you want to import names for
    convenience, but not actually perform the imports until necessary.
    The zope.deferredimport package provided facilities for defining
    names in modules that will be imported from somewhere else when
    used. You can also cause deprecation warnings to be issued when a
    variable is used.
